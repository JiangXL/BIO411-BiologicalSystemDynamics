# The force in Biolology System

Covalent INteractions, Noncovalent Interactions

Higher than 37 degree(thermal motion) will break van der Waals Interaction 

Bonds, angles, dithedrals

**Van der Waals forces** include attraction and repulsions between atoms, 
molecules, and surfaces, as well as other intermolecular forces. They differ 
from covalent and ionic bonding in that they are caused by correlations in the 
fluctuating polarizations of nearby particles.[1]

1s=1e15 fs

> Bug: interaction during moving don't take accout---> decrease step length.

Thermodynamics propertics:
- Temperature: meansure kinetic energies of individual atoms, a averaged kinetic
energy, 3/2 k_bT=E_Kin /N
- Pressure: PV=N*k_b* T + 1/3<\sum_{r_i}{F_i}>

# Dynamical systems theory

An area of mathematics used describe the behavior of complex dynamical systems,
usually by employing differential equations or difference equations.

Continuous: dx/dt=f(x,p,t), x=[x1, x2,......], p=[p1,p2,.....]
Discrete: x(t+1)=f(x(t),t)

Steady state: balanced points


Stable and unstable

Jacobian matrix: stable points
less 0: statble(sink 汇), bigger 0: unstable(source,源), 
equal 0: marginally stable.

equal 0 cener(形成轨道), bigger 0: unstable spiral, less than 0:stable spicral

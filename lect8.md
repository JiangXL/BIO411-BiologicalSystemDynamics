# System

System: Input-output,

Roughly speacking, a physical system consists of interconnected components,
which are characterized by their terminal(input-output) relationships.

## Linear system theory
Two features: homogeneity(scaling)齐次性 ; Additivity(可加性)

Dirac function make it ease to solve linear system problem.
A generalized function is defined by its efect on other funcitonis instrad
of by its value at every instant of time.

Compute the respone:
Zero-input response --> zero-state response

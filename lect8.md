## Linear system theory
Two features: homogeneity(scaling)齐次性 ; Addivity 

friendly to decomposition


Dirac function:
A generalized function is defined by its efect on other funcitonis instrad
of by its value at every instant of time.

Compute the respone:
Zero-input response --> zero-state response

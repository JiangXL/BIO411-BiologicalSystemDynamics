# Laplace transform
It takes a function of a real variable t (often time) to a function of a
complex variable s (complex frequency).

The Laplace transform is very similar to the Fourier transform. While the
Fourier transform of a function is a complex function of a real variable
(frequency), the Laplace transform of a function is a complex function of a
complex variable,
